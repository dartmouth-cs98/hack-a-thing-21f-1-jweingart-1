# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 
I built a 2d maze in Unity3D, with a player who can move around using the keyboard, and is confined by the walls of the maze.

My goal was to also create obstacles that move around the maze, and if you hit them, you have to restart. But it took too long just building the maze and connecting it with Git to make further progress. the reason I wanted to learn Unity3D was that at some point, I want to make a 3D game where users can select different strategies and play against AI, which keeps learning and getting better. I think this would be a cool way for people to experience AI in a fun way.


## Who Did What?
It was an individual effort.

## What you learned
I learned how to link Unity with GitHub, how to design in 2d and 3d in Unity, and how to attach those designs to C Sharp files. These were all sizeable challenges.
